    <h2 style="color: blue;">Significance</h2>
    <p class="signi">Chhath puja is dedicated to the sun god Surya. The sun is visible to every being and is the basis of life<br> of all creatures on earth.[26] Along with the Sun God, Chhathi Maiya is also worshipped<br> on this day. According to Vedic astrology, Chhathi Maiya (or Chhathi Mata) protects<br> the children from diseases and problems and gives them long lives and good health.[27]
    <br>As per legends, Chhath Puja stems from the early Vedic period, where sages <br>would fast for days and perform the puja with mantras from Rigveda. It is believed that Chhath Puja was also performed by Karna,<br> the son of Lord Surya and the king of Anga Desh, <br>which is the modern-day Bhagalpur in Bihar. According to another legend, Pandavas and Draupadi also performed the Puja to overcome obstacles in theirs lives and reclaim their lost kingdom.[27] For the people from Bihar and other close by areas, Chhath Puja is considered as Mahaparva.</p>

    <h3 style="color:hotpink"><b>Nahaay Khaay (Day 1)</b></h3>
    <p class="n1">This is the first day of Chhath Puja. The Parvaitin (transl.â€‰devotees, from Sanskrit parv, meaning "occasion" or "festival") must take a holy bath, after which the entire house, its surroundings and pathways to the Ghat are thoroughly cleaned. The Parvaitin usually cooks Sattvik Lauka Bhaat<br> (Bottle Gourd and Bengal Gram Lentil preparation with Arva Rice Bhaat).<br>
    This preparation is served to the deity in the afternoon as Bhog.<br> This initiates the Parv and is the last meal of the Parvaitin during Chhath Puja. The food is then eaten to protect the mind from thoughts of vengeance.[33]</p>

    <p>Kharna, also known as Rasiaav-Roti or Lohanda, is the second day of Chhath Puja.[34] On this day, the devotees are not allowed to drink even a single drop of water. In the evening, they eat gur ke kheer (Kheer made up of jaggery), called Rasiaav, together with Roti.[35]</p>

    <p>his day is spent preparing the prasad (offerings) at home, often consisting of a bamboo basket decorated with fruits, Thekua and rice laddus. On the eve of this day, the entire household accompany the devotee to a riverbank, pond, or other large body of water to make the Arghya offerings to the setting sun. The occasion can in many ways resemble a carnival. Besides the devotees and their friends and family, numerous participants and onlookers are all willing to help and receive the blessings of the worshipper.</p>

    <h3><b>Bhorka Aragh (Day 4)</b></h3>
    <p>Before sunrise on the last day of Chhath puja, the devotees have to go to the riverbank to offer an arghya to the rising sun. After this, the protection of the child and the peace and happiness of the entire family is sought from Chhatti Maiya. After worship, devotees drink water and eat a little prasad in order to break one's fast. This is called Paran or Parana.</p>
